**One task to efficiently run all code analysis & testing tools in an Elixir project.**

- Runs all tools with a single convenient `mix check` command
- Comes out of the box with a predefined set of curated tools
- Checks the project consistently for all developers & on the CI
- Delivers results faster by running & streaming tools in parallel
- Identifies all project issues in one go by always running all tools
- Empowers umbrella projects with parallel recursion over child apps
- Facilitates custom mix tasks and scripts acting as project checks
- Enables complex parallel workflows via support for cross-tool deps
- Takes care of the little details (compile once, enable ANSI etc)

tools"](http://cloudless.studio/articles/49-one-task-to-rule-all-elixir-analysis-testing-tools)
article.

## Getting started

Add `ex_check` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ex_check, "~> 0.12.0", only: [:dev, :test], runtime: false}
  ]
end
```

Optionally add curated tools to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:credo, ">= 0.0.0", only: :dev, runtime: false},
    {:dialyxir, ">= 0.0.0", only: :dev, runtime: false},
    {:ex_doc, ">= 0.0.0", only: :dev, runtime: false},
    {:sobelow, ">= 0.0.0", only: :dev, runtime: false}
  ]
end
```

Run the check:

```
mix check
```

Optionally generate config to adjust the check:

```
mix check.gen.config
```

## Documentation

Learn more about the tools included in the check as well as its workflow, configuration and options
[on HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_check/Mix.Tasks.Check.html) or by running `mix help check`.

Want to write your own code check? Get yourself started by reading the ["Writing your first Elixir
code check"](http://cloudless.studio/articles/50-writing-your-first-elixir-code-check) article.

## Continuous Integration

With `mix check` you can consistently run the same set of checks locally and on the CI. CI
configuration also becomes trivial and comes out of the box with parallelism and error output from
all checks at once regardless if previous one failed.

Here's the minimal `.travis.yml` to get you started on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org):

```yaml
language: elixir

script: mix check
```

If you use the `dialyzer` tool, you'll also want to cover PLT build timeouts and caching:

```yaml
# ...

before_script:
  - travis_wait mix dialyzer --plt

cache:
  directories:
    - _build
    - deps
```
